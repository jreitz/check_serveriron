check_serveriron
-=-=-=-==-=-=-=-

Nagios checks for Brocade (formerly Foundry) ServerIron utilization.  These checks
should work on any JetCore or ADX based ServerIron but I have a limited number of
configurations on which to test.

check_serveriron_cpu:       CPU utilization for a given WSM.  Monitors all processors 
                              (management and BP(s)).
check_serveriron_sessions:  Session table utilization for a ServerIron chassis.
                              Monitors all BP(s) in all slots.

Written in perl with a minimum of external dependencies.  Includes PNP templates
for graphing the perfdata output from the checks.  Additional SI checks will
be included here soon.
